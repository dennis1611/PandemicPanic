- Some difference in opinion that required a single Product Owner, instead of 4

## Did we have any impediments?
- Tommy left the minor
- We didn't have professional Pycharm yet so we could not view test coverage

## What are our goals for the next sprint?

- Decide if terminal still gets used
- Decide any extra features we still might want to add
