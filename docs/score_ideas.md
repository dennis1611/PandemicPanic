# Ideas for score system
- 2 parts: infected and measures
- Separate scores or together?
- infection score based on df, per region or total?
- regions could be cheesed maybe
- measures: calculate score during turns, or maybe separate dataframe?
- Idea: give each measure a severity
- Severity * duration = (negative) score?
- maybe measures are viewed as 'too severe' if the amount of infections is low
- difficult to program, maybe, requires calculation during turn
- or serious dataframe-magic
