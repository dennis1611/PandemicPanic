# Here, the measures according to our model are placed into the timeline according to the timeline above.
# Dates that are near eachother (such as 11 March and 15 March) are clumped together.

1: distance - 	    March 15th	    until	now
2: lockdown - 	    March 15th	    until	June 1st
		            October 13th	until	now
3: mask - 		    October 13th 	until	now
4: restaurants - 	March 15th	    until	June 1st
		            October 13th	until	now
5: events - 	    March 11th	    until	now
6: visitors - 	    March 15th 	    until	now
7: quarantine - 	March 11th	    until	now
8: education - 	    March 16th	    until	now


# A short overview of the periods is created and the approximate R0- value is recorded according to the "Corona Dashboard" by the Dutch government.
# These approximate values are paired with the measures available in the game to give the possibility of balancing.

until beginning of March:		R0 around 1.9		Measures:	None.
beginning of march until June:	R0 around 0.75		Measures:	1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
June until halfway October:		R0 around 1.15		Measures:	1, 5, 6, 7, (8 not taken into account: schools open and universities partially open).
Halfway October until now:		R0 around   ?		Measures:	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

With measures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: 	    R0 value around 0.75
With measures 1, 5, 6, 7:		        R0 value around 1.15
With measures 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:	    R0 value around ?

So:	m2 x m4 x m8 = 				                around 0.65 (0.75/1.15)
	R_base = 				                    around 1.9
	m1 x m2 x m4 x m5 x m6 x m7 x m8 * R_base	around 0.75

	(m1 x m5 x m6 x m7 * R_base		            around 1.15)
